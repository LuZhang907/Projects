 👋 Greetings, my name is Lu 😁. I am currently a PhD candidate in applied statistics ⚡️.
 
📊 This repository was created to demonstrate some technical skills commonly used by Data Scientists. I created three projects to demonstrate my experience as a project manager at a consulting lab and as a data scientist intern at Rocket Mortgage.

##  🚔 [Standford Open Project: Analysis for Traffic Stops](https://medium.com/@lzhang0907/standford-open-policing-project-analysis-of-traffic-stops-2987b811079f).

Exploratory analyses such as (percentage)cross tables and visualizations were used to answer all term-related queries. Three **R** package were used: **data.table**(parelle reading data, personal prefreference even this data set is modest in here), using **tidyverse** to do data selection, filter, and calulation statistical properties by group, and **ggplot2** to visualize all the results.

## 💫 [NYC Restaurant Data Analysis: How to get the 5-star?](https://medium.com/@lzhang0907/proportional-odds-model-in-r-53698533cab0).

The majority of my consulting clients (Fall 2023 semaster) have either an ordered response variable or a named likert scale response. As a result, I consider the NYC restaurant data, which has ordered responses to replicate similar work I've done for my clients, as documentation to formulate the procedure for managing this data type. Still utilizing **R**, various packages were utilized, with the exception of those for data cleansing and visualization. The unique packages were **ordinal**, which was used to perform the proportional odds modeling (POM), and **effects**, which visualized the parallel assumption for POM.

## All lending club loan data analysis: paid off or charge off?

This is a large data project with millions of data records. I will begin with data cleansing, feature selection, and then modeling. Fundamental machine learning methods will be used to investigate whether the loan will be fully paid or charged off, thereby reducing the company's chance of losing money due to default.
