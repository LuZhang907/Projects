Greetings, my name is Lu. I am currently a PhD candidate in applied statistics.
This repository was created to demonstrate some technical skills commonly used by Data Scientists. I created three projects to demonstrate my experience as a project manager at a consulting firm and as a data scientist intern at Rocket Mortgage.

* Standford open project: traffic stops analysis
* NYC resturant Data analysis: How to get the 5-star rating?
* All lending club loan data analysis: paid off or charge off?
